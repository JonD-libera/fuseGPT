Never run out of files again!

FuseGPT is here to revolutionize how you interact with your filesystem! Imagine a world where every file you try to read exists â€” even if it didn't before! But even better, these files are brimming with completely useless data. 
Yes, it's absurd. Yes, it's amazing. And yes, you'll absolutely love it.

Usage: ```python ./fusegpt.py ~/fuse sk-your-api-key```

```~/fuse$ cat dogs_ascii_art.txt```
